# meteor-reader
Meteor-Reader is a project in the making for studying languages, made for both mobile and the web using Meteor JS and Material Design. The functionality is currently limited to a small demo. 

## Features
* Tap words to display translation and pronunciation (will use your selected language by default)
* Designed so one can add another UI language by using settings files only, no coding required

## Demo
A demo is available at http://sterneberg.meteor.com. There are no dictionaries included yet, but if you click on the Harry Potter text and click on the word "director" you can get a preview on how it will work. Your UI language needs to be set to Chinese on the front page in order for the word to be translated.

## What's Next
This tool will only be useful if it can get any real content and reach a large audience. Please contact me at my listed email address to give suggestions.
